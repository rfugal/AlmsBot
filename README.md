AlmsBot is the [Twilio](https://twilio.com)-based front-end for Text2Alms. Utah-based Text2Alms is a storyteller, a community resource for the unhoused and unemployed, and payment processor. When someone is in need we interview them, check their story, tell their story in 160 characters, and text their story to anyone who texts their name/handle to our number. We then invite the texter to give to the almsman/almswoman through our platform, and Text2Alms forwards alms to those in need.

Our aim is to fill the role of a panhandler credentialing service as described in [this article published in the European Journal of Homelessness](https://www.feantsaresearch.org/download/12-1_b1_thinkpiece_dordick_v028543394139574871091.pdf). The concept of credentialing begins on page 74.

The story could be about where they’ve been, it could also be about where they’re going (or hoping to go) or it could simply be who they are. The purpose of the story told is only to reduce hesitation on the givers part, which is why we limit it to 160 characters. The story told will be approved by the almsperson, and the reason to check their story (with consent and care) is to affirm to donors that the almsperson isn’t a scammer. The story works as confirmation to donors that the almsperson isn’t a stranger.

AlmsBot is open source, and we invite anyone interested to help us develop the code and use it to start up a similar local non-profit.

We make giving and recieving alms easy through communication and personal connection. Potential givers with unanswered questions may hesitate to give alms to the destitue. We answer with personal stories. Visit [www.Text2Alms.org](http://www.text2alms.org) for the 411.

I wrote up [something on r/homeless](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/i8llcf/giving_alms_by_sms/) for some feedback:
> I’m starting a non-profit that is a storyteller, a community resource for the unhoused and unemployed, and a payment (donation) processor. When someone is in need we interview them, fact check their story, tell their story in 160 characters, and text their story to anyone who texts their name/handle to our number. That way anyone flying a sign can add "Text {NAME} to {PHONE_NUMBER}"
<br/>We then invite the texter to give to the almsman/almswoman through our platform, and our organization forwards alms to those in need.
<br/>I’m looking for constructive feedback on the mission, collaboration on interview questions, and contributing developers on the open source code: https://github.com/rfugal/AlmsBot. I'll be reaching out to local orgs as well as local almspersons.

The first comment I got was:
> This is exploitive and dehumanizing. I imagine you think it's the opposite though. How do you plan to fund this venture? By taking a percentage of "alms"? You might want to define that word, btw, rather than assuming everyone knows what you're talking about.

And my response:
>If there’s no percentage taken is it still exploitative? Is flying a sign, panhandling, begging, whatever you call it, always exploitative? I will advocate for better public policy, and people shouldn’t need to beg to get by, but they need to nonetheless. What specifically makes your conception of this idea exploitative, I really do want your feedback so I can change the design? Cash in hand does so much good that programs cannot. It’s not that expensive to run an SMS service, storytellers can work pro bono, donors can be asked to cover transaction fees.
<br/>Like so much fundraising on ActBlue, I’m thinking incremental asks, like the following: <br/>Thank you for asking about Kirk. Can you give him $20 today? (All money goes to Kirk as cash). <br/>Can you add $1.20 to cover transaction fees? <br/>Would you add $2 for local programs for the unhoused and the hungry?

The second comment was:
> What if it's a triggering horrific story? It feels like poverty porn.

And my response:
> The purpose of the story told is only to reduce hesitation on the givers part, which is why we limit it to 160 characters. With a text, someone who hesitates to give (or who has no cash on hand) can rethink their decision to pass by without giving.
<br/>And the story told would be approved by the almsperson. The interview would be longer, and could be as long as the interviewee needs and desires. In my experience, people want someone to listen.
<br/>The reason to “fact check” their story (with consent and care) is to affirm to the donors that the almsperson isn’t a scammer. The story confirms to donors that the almsperson isn’t a stranger.
<br/>The story could be about where they’ve been, it could also be about where they’re going (or hoping to go) or it could simply be who they are.
